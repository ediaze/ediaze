# Proofs of concept

Proofs of concept in the different technologies that I feel interested in and that I think it is important to share with others. Each of the proofs of concept has its corresponding repository as well as the information of the reference sources used for its creation.

## About Edwin Diaz

I am a software developer with Back-End experience and eager to become skilled in Front-End development. I work in a company that allows me to take user stories to improve my strengths and I have decided to put on this site all the proofs of concept that I will begin to perform to achieve that goal of being a Full-Stack developer.
